# CodePen

`+` Hides complexity (but is it really a plus?)
`+` Easier to get going (not project / stack / files to set up)
`-` May not feel professional

- [ ] syntax autocompletion?
- [ ] Error highlighting?

# Codio
`+` HTML tags autocompletion
`+` Error highlighting
`+` Feels like a professional development tool
`+` Git integration (great with [Ungit](http://forum.codio.com/t/install-and-use-ungit-on-codio/885)!)
`-` No live preview, going back and forward from browser tabs is not a good learning experience. You want to see things changing immediately
