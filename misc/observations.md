# General

* Stress the importance of **copy-paste**, maybe have a slide for that (*Good programmers copy* or so)

* Highlight the importance of **searching** for solutions online (*Google is your friend*, StackOverflow) and being able to **scan** results.

* Introduce the mindset of ***seeing behind the scenes***, having a way to understand what's going on so that we can hack/fix it.

# Session 1

### What went well

* Great atmosphere - open space room, table arrangement in U-shape, a few plants 
* Getting to know each other - students introduced one another, friendly dynamic
* Great opening conversation getting excited about apps and the future of technology
* Asking the students questions as a way to get them thinking and coming up with solutions and reasons 

### Areas for improvement

* Conversations sometimes need steering away from dead ends, for instance how many billions celebrities make from apps
* Using visual cues to move conversations forward
* Need to emphasise that we are teaching simplified templates for prototyping purposes - managing expectations
* Need to explain that the app-building process is extensive and takes a lot of work, a long process
* Emphasise how important it is to be able to build great, fully thought through prototypes to be able to have informed conversations with designers, developers, partners etc

### Action points

* Explain what CodePen is
* Use `head` and `body`
* Explain Mac shortcuts (copy, paste, scroll etc)
* Slide to **manage expectations** after introductions
