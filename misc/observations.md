# Day 1

### What went well

* Introduction was super. The way we modelled our introductions (presenting each other through a personal story) made students more open to share their own personal stories.

* Splitting tables to 4 sections helped people get taking.   

* Printing the session notes helped. People were taking notes on them.

### Areas for improvement

* The room needs to be cleaned.  

* *What is an app* discussion had too many questions and we dragged in on for too long.

* *How long does it take to make an app* not so relevant for this crowd, who are more interested in coding than app-making.

* No to whiteboard, you can't move things around.

### Action points

* Add more image-based practice in CSS to get people more  engaged. We encourage them by adding more media elements to the course.
 
* *What is an app?* can be a whole-class quick q&a (max 10 minutes), maybe cut down the questions and change them so that they lead into the 3 **key concepts**.

* Add HTML and CSS **comments** to the notes.


Idea for next session 1 presentation:

1. Welcome, introductions and plan, then:
* **What is code?** Get people to shout out some ideas and keywords, like *instructions*, *rules*, *data* etc.
* How do you **learn to code**? Introduce the `mantras`:

	* How did you learn your first natural language? By **copying** people around you, trying out things and see what reactions you get
	* Learning to code is a **trial&error** process. We're not at school, so making mistakes is good! Mistakes are opportunities to learn.
	* Good coders don't type. They **copy-paste**.
	* Good coders don't try to remember everything. They know how to **search** for solutions online and integrate ready-made code in their projects.
	* Spot the difference (**patterns**) with a few HTML and CSS examples?
	
		```html
		✔️ <p>Read me</p>
		✔️ <a>Click me</a>
		❌ <a>Click me<a/>
		✔️ <a href="http://copy.it">Click me</a>
		❌ <a> href="http://copy.it"Click me</a>
		```
		
	* Learn by **making**
* Your **brief**: make an app that...
* **What is an app?**

	* small digital tool connected to the Web
	* swiss-army knife
	* 3 key concepts: 	**interface**, **data** and **logic**
* If there's time, **analyse** an app in small groups.
* Zunch!
