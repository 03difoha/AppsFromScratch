# General

* Stress the importance of **copy-paste**, maybe have a slide for that (*Good programmers copy* or so)

* Highlight the importance of **searching** for solutions online (*Google is your friend*, StackOverflow) and being able to **scan** results.

* Introduce the mindset of ***seeing behind the scenes***, having a way to understand what's going on so that we can hack/fix it.

* **Research** task on competitor apps 

* Working knowledge of a Mac is desired, otherwise here's a cheatsheet with common **shortcuts**.


# Day 1

### What went well

* Great atmosphere - open space room, table arrangement in U-shape, a few plants 
* Getting to know each other - students introduced one another, friendly dynamic
* Great opening conversation getting excited about apps and the future of technology
* Asking the students questions as a way to get them thinking and coming up with solutions and reasons 

### Areas for improvement

* Conversations sometimes need steering away from dead ends, for instance how many billions celebrities make from apps
* Using visual cues to move conversations forward
* Need to emphasise that we are teaching simplified templates for prototyping purposes - managing expectations
* Need to explain that the app-building process is extensive and takes a lot of work, a long process
* Emphasise how important it is to be able to build great, fully thought through prototypes to be able to have informed conversations with designers, developers, partners etc

### Action points

* Explain what CodePen is
* Use `head` and `body`
* Explain Mac shortcuts (copy, paste, scroll etc)
* Slide to **manage expectations** after introductions


# Day 2

### What went well

* Having multiple lecturer let them think that it's not just one way but gave them multiple perspectives.
* Engaged by the playful demonstration
* Felt involved with team work. 
* Didn't feel scared to say things.
* Balance between coding practice and process learning is well balanced


### Areas for improvement

* Being open space could distract them when there are someone talking outside class.
* It would be nice if the tables are easier to move around.
* Want to try something easier which is more rewarding (possibly something more visual or sound, playful)

### Action points

* Find fun activities for end of day
* How to market your app and idea? (Find where we can direct them to another resources)
* Resources / links: jQuery courses etc.
* JS library: how do you know if thats good library?


# Day 3

### What went well

* Hot Berta is a good example of bad design
* GoodUI examples and discussion that followed
* Wireframes (good and bad) examples

### Areas for improvement

* Be realistic about how much new coding concepts one can take in a couple of hours.  

### Action points

* Swap coding session from AM to PM, so that we avoid late-comers to get lost
* Code indentation (tidiness) is important
* Codepen JS hint?
* **Research** task on competitor apps 
* Write out JS functions on post-its and work out together which order they will be put together. Then split people up into groups and get them to write the code that makes the app work
