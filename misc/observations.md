# Day 1

### What went well

* Introduction was super. The way we modelled our introductions (presenting each other through a personal story) made students more open to share their own personal stories.

* Splitting tables to 4 sections helped people get taking.   

* Printing the session notes helped. People were taking notes on them.

### Areas for improvement

* The room needs to be cleaned.  

* *What is an app* discussion had too many questions and we dragged in on for too long.

* *How long does it take to make an app* not so relevant for this crowd, who are more interested in coding than app-making.

* No to whiteboard, you can't move things around.

### Action points

* Add more image-based practice in CSS to get people more  engaged. We encourage them by adding more media elements to the course.
 
* *What is an app?* can be a whole-class quick q&a (max 10 minutes), maybe cut down the questions and change them so that they lead into the 3 **key concepts**.

* Add HTML and CSS **comments** to the notes.


Idea for next session 1 presentation:

1. Welcome, introductions and plan, then:
* **What is code?** Get people to shout out some ideas and keywords, like *instructions*, *rules*, *data* etc.
* How do you **learn to code**? Introduce the `mantras`:

	* How did you learn your first natural language? By **copying** people around you, trying out things and see what reactions you get
	* Learning to code is a **trial&error** process. We're not at school, so making mistakes is good! Mistakes are opportunities to learn.
	* Good coders don't type. They **copy-paste**.
	* Good coders don't try to remember everything. They know how to **search** for solutions online and integrate ready-made code in their projects.
	* Spot the difference (**patterns**) with a few HTML and CSS examples?
	
		```html
		✅ <p>Read me</p>
		✅ <a>Click me</a>
		❌ <a>Click me<a/>
		✅ <a href="http://copy.it">Click me</a>
		❌ <a> href="http://copy.it"Click me</a>
		```
		
	* Learn by **making**
* Your **brief**: make an app that...
* **What is an app?**

	* small digital tool connected to the Web
	* swiss-army knife
	* 3 key concepts: 	**interface**, **data** and **logic**
* If there's time, **analyse** an app in small groups.
* Zunch!	
		

# Day 2

### What went well

* Room was really lovely and clean which left us some much needed preparation time beforehand
* Clickable mice really helped, at least 4 people
* Good for people to bring their own laptops - more comfortable
* Slow pace CSS recap
* Good to have two separate print outs for morning and afternoon - people navigated information easily
* People used the print-outs to get ahead while waiting for others to catch up
* People understood variables and objects through testing in the console
* Better balance between the three of us speaking, added variety

### Areas for improvement

#### HTML & CSS

* HTML & CSS recap took 1.5 hours, and left no time for UX research
* Before coding demonstrations, disclaimer: *if you're stuck at all then raise your hand and we'll come round to help out, we don't always spot you otherwise!*
* CSS specific - use `border: solid 2px red;` instead of `border-width: 2px; border-color: green;` etc.
* Harpinder suggested a **CSS cheatsheet** with common properties (there are many online we could point them to)

#### Light activities for the start of the day

* We can start with a group activity to wake people up and get them talking (also while late-comers are trickling in, and we can't start coding without them really)
* From 11:00 - 11:30 we should start discussions and slightly less important stuff so that we can get started immediately - more time for critical demonstrations once the late-comers arrive
* It's ok to have an **early lunch**!

#### Facilitator tips

* **Smile** more :simple_smile: 
* **Stand up** when doing coding demonstrations and walk around a bit - send your voice across the whole room, moving from table to table, quizzing them a bit.
* Remember to talk UPWARDS, rather then down towards your screen 
* It may be helpful for the non-leading facilitators to chip in as well and give an overview of what we're doing, telling funny anecdote or just remind people of why we're doing this.

#### The dreaded Console

* When we use the **Console** we must clarify that we aren't working directly on their apps but rather doing an exercise to become familiar with JS.
* Console demo: people didn't get the Terminal reference,  objects and functions could have been explained a bit more (demo a couple of times, then ask students to **repeat on their own** and solidify their learning)
* [aimee.js](https://github.com/CodeAndCake/AppsFromScratch/tree/v3/sessions/02#lets-interact-with-aimee) was confusing, lost some people coming away from the Console to github. We could turn it into a Thimble project, with `aimee.js` preloaded

* Note, our displays look a bit different on PC (?)

### Action points	

* Mozilla Thimble emails not sent! What to do in this scenario? 	- get students to export and email their projects to themselves JUST IN CASE (this is sorted now, see https://github.com/mozilla/login.webmaker.org/issues/374)
* Swap UX research and HTML+CSS recap. 
* Laptop trolley always **electrocutes** me when I bring it in and out of the lift.
* Create a **shared document for sharing links**, a sort of copy-paste bin for coding demos (because you can't expect people to type in long URL like `github.com/CodeAndCake/AppsFromScratch/blob/v3/sessions/02/aimee.js`).
