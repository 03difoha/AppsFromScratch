# Day 1

### What went well

* Introduction was super.   
* Splitting tables to 4 sections helped people get taking.   
* Printing the session notes helped.

### Areas for improvement

* Ravensbourne needs to be cleaned.  
* *What is an app* discussion had too many questions and too long.
* *How long does it take to make an app* not so relevant for this crowd (more interested in coding than app-making)
* No to whiteboard, you can't move things around

### Action points

* Add more image based practice in CSS to get more people engaged. We encourage them by adding more media based elements to the course. 
* *What is an app?* can be a whole-class quick q&a (max 10 minutes), maybe cut down the questions and change them so that they lead into the 3 key concepts
