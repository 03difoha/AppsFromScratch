# Apps from scratch

<!--Start prototyping and building apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this 24-hour (6 weekly sessions) introductory course. -->

**Learn to design and code apps!**

Working from a hands-on brief, you will write your first line of code and in a few weeks you will have made your own app.

You will experience the design and development process first-hand, and get to know the fabrics of the Web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs.

This course is a great starting point in your app-making journey.



<!--Suitable for people who have never written a line of code, this course will guide you through the design, prototype and development process that leads to the creation of a web-based application.

Working on hands-on briefs, you will learn the principles of programming and get familiar with the fabrics of the Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs).-->

When	| What	
---	| ----	
[Day 1](sessions/01/README.md)		| Get to know each other <br>Discuss: what is an app, how do we use them, how do we start building one? <br>Introduction to HTML and CSS: create your app home screen
[Day 2](sessions/02/README.md)		| Work together to generate, spec out and test your ideas <br>UX research: interview people (aka users) <br>Introduction to JavaScript: connect your app to an online database
[Day 3](sessions/03/README.md)		| Interface design: sketch out your appâ€™s pages <br>Learn how to use digital wireframing tools <br>Mark up your wireframes with HTML and CSS 
[Day 4](sessions/04/README.md)		| Review your wireframes collaboratively <br>JavaScript: learn about variables, functions and loops <br>Code your app with JavaScript 
[Day 5](sessions/05/README.md)		| Make! <br>Test! <br>Tweak! Repeat...
[Day 6](sessions/06/README.md)		| Finalise  and present your app prototype <br>Celebrate your achievements! <br>Take away resources to continue on your app-making journey



# Learning goals

By the end of this course you will be able to:

1. Discuss **app ideas** in terms of *interface*, *logic* and *data* with designers and developers.
* **Visualise interaction flows** with analog (paper) and digital tools.
* Break down **behaviour** (including human behaviour) into *algorithms*, that is steps and routines that can be coded.  
* Explain the differences between **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** in terms of purpose and syntax.
* Integrate *ready-made* blocks of code in your own project.  
* Identify **bugs** (unexpected behaviours in apps or code errors) using tools to *inspect* apps and come up with possible explanations.
* Evaluate online resources when **searching** for solutions to design challenges and coding issues.
* Create **proof-of-concept prototypes** for Web apps, which manipulate data from online databases and/or **APIs**.



<!--1. Understand the role of the three pillar **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*. 
* Understand how **data APIs** work (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters) and hook up one (or more) APIs to your Web application.
* Critically analyse the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.-->
