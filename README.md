<!--Start prototyping and building apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this 24-hour (6 weekly sessions) introductory course. -->

### Learn to design and code apps!

Working from a hands-on brief, you will write your first line of code and in a few weeks you will have made your own app.

You will experience the design and development process first-hand, and get to know the fabrics of the Web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs.

This course is a great starting point in your app-making journey.

<!--
Suitable for people who have never written a line of code, this course will guide you through the design, prototype and development process that leads to the creation of a web-based application.

Working on hands-on briefs, you will learn the principles of programming and get familiar with the fabrics of the Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs).

# What's the plan?

When	| What	
---	| ----	
[Day 1<br>![](sessions/img/day-1.jpg)](sessions/01/README.md)	| On the first day we discuss key concepts around apps (interface, logic, data) and start making with HTML & CSS.
[Day 2<br>![](sessions/img/day-2.jpg)](sessions/02/README.md)		| We work together to generate, spec out and test your app ideas. Then start programming with JavaScript.
[Day 3<br>![](sessions/img/day-3.jpg)](sessions/03/README.md)		| You'll apply your research to sketch out how your app looks and behaves on paper. Then you'll make digital wireframes.
[Day 4<br>![](sessions/img/day-4.jpg)](sessions/04/README.md)		| You'll present your app designs and we'll review them together. Then get into the core concepts of programming.
[Day 5<br>![](sessions/img/day-5.jpg)](sessions/05/README.md)		| You will use JavaScript _libraries_ to speed up your development and learn how to troubleshoot your code, aka _debugging_.
[Day 6<br>![](sessions/img/day-6.jpg)](sessions/06/README.md)		| Tweak your app prototype. Celebrate your achievements, and take away free resources to continue your learning journey.


# Learning goals

By the end of this course you will be able to:

1. Discuss **app ideas** in terms of *interface*, *logic* and *data* with designers and developers.
* **Visualise interaction flows** with analog (paper) and digital tools.
* Break down **behaviour** (including human behaviour) into *algorithms*, that is steps and routines that can be coded.  
* Explain the differences between **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** in terms of purpose and syntax.
* Integrate *ready-made* blocks of code in your own project.  
* Identify **bugs** (unexpected behaviours in apps or code errors) using tools to *inspect* apps and come up with possible explanations.
* Evaluate online resources when **searching** for solutions to design challenges and coding issues.
* Create **proof-of-concept prototypes** for Web apps, which manipulate data from online databases and/or **APIs**.

<!--1. Understand the role of the three pillar **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*. 
* Understand how **data APIs** work (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters) and hook up one (or more) APIs to your Web application.
* Critically analyse the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.-->
