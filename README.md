# Apps from scratch

Suitable for people who have never written a line of code, this course will guide you through the design, prototype and development process that leads to the creation of a web-based application.

Working on hands-on briefs, you will learn the principles of programming and get familiar with the fabrics of the Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs).

# Learning goals

Upon completion of this course you will be able to:

1. Understand the role of the three pillar **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*. 
* Understand how **data APIs** work (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters) and hook up one (or more) APIs to your Web application.
* Critically analyse the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.
* Create **proof-of-concept functional prototypes** for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s).
