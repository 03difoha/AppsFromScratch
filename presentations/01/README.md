## Apps from scratch

This course is about getting **creative** with **code**.

For many of you, this will be a **memorable day**! You'll write your **first line of code**, and in a few weeks you'll have made **your very own app**, from **scratch**!

Exciting, **fun**!

*On a practical note*, we will have lunch **break** at around 12:00 (1 hour), aiming to wrap up by 3pm.


## Two words about ourselves

**No computer scientists**.


## What is code?

Can you think of examples of words with `code` in them? (*Morse code*, *post code*, *dress code*...)

Code existed before computers.

Code is about **communication**. If I want to talk to my **grandma**, I need to use Italian. To communicate with you, I use English. To **talk to a computer**, I use..

It's **instructions** to a computer: extremely powerful, fundamentally thick.

### Thick machines

Imagine a computer is your most pedantic **friend**: 

* **break down** every step
* be **precise**
* it will take you **literally**


## What are computers good at?

COMPUTERS → **Computing** (calculating very fast, comparing quantities), **repeating** (boring) tasks endlessly, **executing** instructions, **storing** data. 

### What are you good at?	

PEOPLE → **Spotting patterns** (connecting the dots), thinking **outside the box**, **inventing** new tools and new ways to use old **tools**.

**Code is a tool**, is how we can get computers to do the **heavy lifting for us**, so that we can focus on being **creative**.

PEOPLE are **good at writing code**.


## How do you learn to code?

Like **learning a new language**, **translating** your ideas into code.

**Today** you're going to learn **2 new languages**.

A bit of **grammar** and **vocabulary**, and mostly you can learn by **copying**.


## Copy + hack

To learn typography, you copy and **edit** fonts. 

To become a pattern cutter, you **deconstruct** and copy good garments.

To make things on the Web, you **inspect** and copy good websites.

**Today** you're going to **copy us** for a bit, then **hack** what you've copied into something **new**.


## Your brief

Make an app that helps people **make lunch**.

The app must take in some human **input**, use **code** to manipulate it, and then present a human-readable **output**.


<!-- ## Today

You will make an **app**.  

We will show you a few **coding tricks** and we'll lay the **foundations** of your app together. 

Then you will explore the **potential of the Web** as an open platform for you to **express your creativity**. -->


## What is the Web?

The Web is not the Internet. If the Internet is a global **brain** (infrastructure), the Web is all the **memories and thoughts** that run on top of it.

Super-short history of the Web.

The WWW started as a way of **linking** academic documents together, over **2 computers in Switzerland**. 

TBL → **hypertext + Internet = WWW**, he specified a set of **rules** (HTTP) for computers to exchange documents over the Internet, and a standard **format** for these documents (HTML). 


## How does it WWWork?

You enter an address or click somewhere.

The **browser** turns your request into a HTTP request and sends it out to the Internet, to find a resource/page/site that responds to your request.

If you haven't mistyped your request, this will reach a server on the other end.

A **server** is a computer that is always on. Receives requests and cooks responses, which are sent back to the browser as **HTML+CSS+JS code**.

**RESTaurant analogy**. Sometimes (in the old days) the server sends back a **cooked meal**, in most cases it sends back a list of **ingredients** and a **recipe**.


## HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Different **languages**, different **concerns** (or jobs/purposes)

HTML → structure and content 

CSS → style and design 

JS → behaviour and logic

**RECIPE analogy** (ingredients - serving suggestions - method)
