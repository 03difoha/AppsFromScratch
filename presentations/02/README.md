# Presentation

- [ ] in the last episode.. HTML + CSS recap (with *spot the difference*?)
- [ ] what's JS again? Powerful, a bit harder

## Robot time!

Let's pretend I'm a **robot** and you have to **code me**.

* **Mission**: find an object in the room, pick it up.
* I only understand these **commands**: `walk(steps)` and `turn(degrees)`
* I can asnwer **questions**, only with a `yes` or `no`

People usually start by giving you very *specific instructions* (eg: walk 3 steps, turn 45 degrees, walk 2 steps..): **remote-controlling**

We can then make them their code more *abstract* and *flexible* with **logic** and **functions**.
	
(The idea is to engage people with an [easy task](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/08/31/0956797612446024.abstract) before we challenge them with a demanding one)
	

## Let's talk about POP

Principles of Programming

Before we start coding the **behaviour** of our app, let's pretend that I'm a **robot** and you need to code me.

**Building blocks**

* Data → Variables **nouns**
* Actions → Functions **verbs**
* Decisions → Logic **conjunctions**
