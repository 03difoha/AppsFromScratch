# Let's celebrate!

And remember...


1. Googling problems is not *cheating*
	
	> Google is your friend
2. Copy-pasting code is not *cheating*

	> Good coders type, great coders copy-paste
4. Iterate and collaborate
   
   > Try again (and again) until it works and ask for feedback
5. **It's OK**. You're not going to break anything
