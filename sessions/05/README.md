# Designing behaviours

Not just interfaces.

We deal with interfaces, tools and devices, but what we design, ultimately, are **human behaviours**. 

We design means to **enforce**, **prevent** or **facilitate** behaviours.

### Persuasive interfaces

# Telling the user story

Don't present *features*. Tell a *story*.

1. **WHO** 

	* Think about a realistic *protagonist*
	* Give her a name
 	* Make her relatable
2. **WHERE** and **WHEN** 

	Think about a scenario
3. **HOW** 

	What are the *feelings* of your protagonist?
4. **WHAT** 

	* What *actions* does she take? 
	* What are their *results*?

# Wireframing

See last session's [notes on wireframing](../04/README.md#wireframes)

Think about the **3-4 key pages** that communicate what's unique about your app and how it benefits who uses it

Use [Moqups](https://moqups.com) or [Divshot](https://architect.divshot.com) to create your wireframes

# Prototyping

We'll show you hot to use [Invision](http://invisionapp.com), to link your wireframes and set them in motion.

Your prototypes will communicate how your app works, and offer a springboard for conversations with developers, designers, collaborators, investors...


# Presentations

* Mention *competitors*
* Mention *market* and *business opportunities*
* Talk about *customer research* (remember [interviews](../03/README.md#who-are-your-users)?)
* Tell us the story of your user (through a [prototype]())
* Talk about *impact*


# Wrap up

1. Understand the role of the three key **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*. 

2. Googling problems  is not *cheating*
	
	> Google is your friend
3. Copy-pasting code is not *cheating*

	> Good coders type, great coders copy-paste
4. Unpack the **design process**: iterative, collaborative
   
   > Try again (and again) until it works.
5. **It's OK**. You're not going to break anything
6. Analyse the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.
7. Create **proof-of-concept prototypes** for Web applications


We'd like to hear your **feedback**, it helps us improve this course!
