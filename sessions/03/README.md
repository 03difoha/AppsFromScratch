## Presentation

 
* What is design?

	* **Design** is a response to an inquiry or a problem
	* Bad design examples?
	* People don't come to your site/app to see your pretty "design" 

* Have a clear, **step-by-step process** to help you through the creation of your app

* **Thinking through** your ideas in detail helps identify potential problems, gaps in your knowledge, and assumptions before you dive into code.

	Taking the time to step back and think about **audience** and explore **multiple ideas** will lead to a more successful solution
	
	* What is your goal?
	* Who is your audience? 
	* What is the key issue you are addressing? 
	<!--* What is the key issue you are addressing?-->
	<!--* What causes it? -->
	
* **Brainstorming** helps you to work with peers to kickstart an idea or concept for a design.


* **Impact mapping** helps you to focus on the goal you are trying archive by mapping out the cause and effect.


* **Wireframing** act as blueprints for app implementation


* **User testing** allows you to explore your assumptions and see what improvements need to be made to your design.





























### Notes

<!--* Ideas generation and pitches
* List app ideas
* Vote for ideas (on a spreadsheet)
* Form groups (use an app that connects to the spreadsheet to suggest groups?)

- [ ] [What is an app?](http://bogost.com/blog/what_is_an_app), where an app is like a music tune, a small thing compared to a record

> Referring to applications as *apps* is not just a branding technique but a necessary linguistic reduction to conceptualize a lesser type of application. A little piece of software that sits in its little sandbox and doesnâ€™t try to compete with the overarching platform.

## Teamwork Process
Idea is just idea without communication. 

##### 1. Research
* Card sorting [https://www.captechconsulting.com/blogs/tools-for-the-ux-architect-card-sort](https://www.captechconsulting.com/blogs/tools-for-the-ux-architect-card-sort)
* Mental models [http://www.uxforthemasses.com/example-ux-docs/](http://www.uxforthemasses.com/example-ux-docs/)

* [UX design sprint from Mozilla](https://habber.makes.org/thimble/LTEyNTgyMjU0MDg=/user-centered-design-sprint)

##### 2. Sketch first thought
<!--* Issue Mapping-->
* Impact Mapping
<!--* Paper prototyping-->
* Wireframing
<!--* Experience map-->

##### 3. Collaborate

Other team, specialist, users



##### 4. Prototype & test
Process of understanding the product by trial and error 


##### 5. Launch & learn more
It's not end of the process. 
Users have wide audience in age group and disability
User doesn't come to the site to see your pretty design
