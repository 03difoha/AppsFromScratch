# Session 3

1. What is design? 
* What is an *app*?

## App ideas
* Ideas generation and pitches
* List app ideas
* Vote for ideas (on a spreadsheet)
* Form groups (use an app that connects to the spreadsheet to suggest groups?)
- [ ] Brainswarming

- [ ] [What is an app?](http://bogost.com/blog/what_is_an_app), where an app is like a music tune, a small thing compared to a record

> Referring to applications as *apps* is not just a branding technique but a necessary linguistic reduction to conceptualize a lesser type of application. A little piece of software that sits in its little sandbox and doesnâ€™t try to compete with the overarching platform.
