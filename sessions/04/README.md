# [Impact mapping](http://impactmapping.org/drawing.php)

Impact mapping is a strategic planning technique.

An impact map is a visualisation of scope and underlying assumptions, created collaboratively. 

It is a mind-map grown during a discussion facilitated by answering the following four questions:

#### Why?
The centre of an impact map answers the most important question: Why are we doing this? This is the goal we are trying to achieve.

#### Who?
The first branch of an impact map provides answers to the following questions: Who can produce the desired effect? Who can obstruct it? Who are the consumers or users of our product? Who will be impacted by it? These are the actors who can influence the outcome.

#### How?
The second branch level of an impact map sets the actors in the perspective of our business goal. It answers the following questions: How should our actors' behaviour change? How can they help us to achieve the goal? How can they obstruct or prevent us from succeeding? These are the impacts that we're trying to create.

#### What?
Once we have the first three questions answered, we can talk about scope. The third branch level of an impact map answers the following question: What can we do, as an organisation or a delivery team, to support the required impacts? These are the deliverables, software features and organisational activities.

2.  Exercise: pick one of the students goals and do the mapping together
3. Students do their maps in pairs 
 


# User stories

Have you ever heard of [**BDD** *behaviour-driven development*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)?

BDD uses the specification of **desired behaviour** as a *ubiquitous language* for all project team members. 

A ubiquitous language is a (semi-)formal language that is shared by all members of a team as a common means of discussing the domain of the project in question.

### What are user stories?

Plain English sentences that **describe the basic units of functionality** of your product.

Useful to:

* state **product requirements** without writing endless pages of documentation
* have a **checklist** for software development 
* not depended on the whims of a stakeholder 
* get *everyone on the same page*

![](assets/dilbert-userstories.jpg)

In one sentence, a user story encapsulates

* **Who** is this functionality for?
* **What** does s/he want?
* **When** does s/he want it?  
* **Why** is it valuable to the her?

### The actual format

As a `who?`, I want to `what?`, so that `why?` [`when`]

#### Examples

* As `an administrator`, I want to `search for my customers by their first and last names`, so that `I quickly find specific people to contact`.
* As `a user`, when `closing the application`, I want to `be prompted to save anything that has changed since the last save` so that `I don't lose work`.
* As `a student`, I want to `find my grades online` so that `I don't have to wait until the next day to know whether I passed`.
* As `a book shopper`, I want to `read reviews of a selected book` to `help me decide whether to buy it`.
* As `an author`, I want `the spell checker to ignore words with numbers` so that `only truly misspelled words are indicated`.

### How do you write user stories?

1. Brainstorm and jot down **players** in the **system**, eg: visitor, potential customer, new customer, customer, system admin, developer, content editor
* For each player, jot down **actions** s/he may want to do, eg: read about the service, get contact details, find info about opening times.. 
* For each action think about `before I do that, I need to` chains.
* Separate actions between **tasks** (intermediate in a chain) and **goals** (end of chain) 
* Map actions to players (one action could be assigned to more than one player)
* Write a user story for each action assigned to a player, from the player perspective.
* **WHO and WHAT are required**, WHY and WHEN are optional
* Organise actions that the system **must / could / shouldn't** allows players to do


### Your stories

1. Open [**this spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/186THtFpf1sIfaWMRGbU6hfNBfKwcJQeFxP255E4wZK4/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Duplicate the `_blank` sheet and give it your name
3. Jot down stories following the [steps above](#how-do-you write-user-stories)
