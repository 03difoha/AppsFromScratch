# [Impact mapping](http://impactmapping.org/drawing.php)

Impact mapping is a strategic planning technique.

An impact map is a visualisation of scope and underlying assumptions, created collaboratively. 

It is a mind-map grown during a discussion facilitated by answering the following four questions:

#### Why?
The centre of an impact map answers the most important question: Why are we doing this? This is the goal we are trying to achieve.

#### Who?
The first branch of an impact map provides answers to the following questions: Who can produce the desired effect? Who can obstruct it? Who are the consumers or users of our product? Who will be impacted by it? These are the actors who can influence the outcome.

#### How?
The second branch level of an impact map sets the actors in the perspective of our business goal. It answers the following questions: How should our actors' behaviour change? How can they help us to achieve the goal? How can they obstruct or prevent us from succeeding? These are the impacts that we're trying to create.

#### What?
Once we have the first three questions answered, we can talk about scope. The third branch level of an impact map answers the following question: What can we do, as an organisation or a delivery team, to support the required impacts? These are the deliverables, software features and organisational activities.

2.  Exercise: pick one of the students goals and do the mapping together
3. Students do their maps in pairs 
 


# User stories

Aka BDD (behaviour-driven development)

See https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/UX-design/blob/2015/sessions/session-13.md#user-stories

### BDD
 
1. In order to [benefit]

An example with BBC website:

1. As a user of BBC website
2. I want to have a web page for every TV brand of the BBC
3. So that I can get all the information about my favourite Brand


# Wireframes

2 options

1. with code: Bootstrap or Foundation, maybe using the [Divshot](https://divshot.com/features) tool, [Layout It](http://www.layoutit.com/), [Jetstrap](https://jetstrap.com/)
2. without code: using Moqups or Balsamiq
