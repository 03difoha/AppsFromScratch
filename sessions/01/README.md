# Apps from scratch

* Have you made an app before?
* Have you used an app before?
* Have you tried to learn code before?


This course is about getting **creative** with **code**.

Getting familiar with how coders work day to day, and experiencing the **design and development process** first-hand. How to take an idea from zero to working prototype. 

For many of you, this will be a **memorable day**. You'll write your **first line of code**, and in a few weeks you'll have made **your very own app**, from scratch!

It's going to be **challenging** and we want to make sure that you also have **fun**!



> Half of development process is about **discussing the ideas** and **collaborating as a team** rather than sitting in front of computer all the time so we would like to go through with you, how to get the idea into app with **the method** that we have been practicing to get best out of it day to day.   
 

We're not here to talk at you, but to work with you and we want you to **work together** and help each other.

 

## Two words about ourselves


Yuki: studied art, now develops software at [The Mill](http://www.themill.com) a post-production, visual effects and animation company (working on films like The Gladiator). He's designing and building software that makes work easier and more efficient for the team.

> Matteo studied **graphic design**. He built various **social platforms** and **educational games** for the **BBC**, **Science Museum** and now **teaches at Ravensbourne.**  

> I'm doing this course also to learn. It's been one of the challenge for me to **break down** the technical idea into something more **friendly**. I'm here to learn a **way to communicate** with ???.

> Matteo came to ask me if I'm interested in doing this course and I was very excited!

> So please point out if I'm talking gibberish.

**No computer scientists**, learned code by ourselves and built a career on it.


We're both curious and passionate about sharing our knowledge.

> Since Matteo and I started in programming, we've been sharing ideas and technics.

> Development is about **community and sharing**. The reason we can stand where we are now is because of the people who contribute to the community for free.

We believe **everyone can learn to code** and that's why we're here today. We want to help you find your direction and accelerate your learning process.


## Introduce each other

We want this session to be **informal** and relaxed, so if you have any questions at any time just ask. We're also going to ask you many **questions**!

> I think this is great opportunity to share and get to know new people. So please don't hesitate, we are always up for beers!
	
> We'd like you to introduce yourself to your neighbour. 

> We'll ask you to introduce each other to the rest of the group.



1. A bit about yourself
* Why are you on this course?
* What is your experience with coding so far?

You can jot down the answers on post-its and we'll then stick them on the wall...


## When is lunch?

Research shows that people focus much better when they know what time they're going to eat..

So, we will have **lunch break** at around 12:00 for 1 hour, aiming to wrap up by 3pm.

## Roadmap

### Day 1

Setting the foundations: getting familiar with code (introducing two languages, **HTML & CSS**) and learning how to code the layout for an app.

Key questions: 

* What is *code*? 
* How do you learn to code?

### Day 2

Stepping up a notch: set things in motion (introducing **JavaScript**) and learning how to use data from the Web in your code.

Key questions: 

* Where is *data*? 
* How do you harness is?

### Day 3

Learning how to visualise your ideas, sketch out possible solutions (introducing the **wireframing** method) and start a conversation with your team.

Key questions:
 
* What is an *app*? 
* How do you design one?

### Day 4

Translating your wireframes into code: how to quickly **prototype and test** your app. Introducing *behaviour-driven-development*.

Key questions: 

* What does your app do? 
* How do you *test* it?

### Day 5

Polishing up and presenting your prototypes.

Key questions: 

* What is your app value? 
* How do you communicate it?



## What is code?

Can you fill in the blanks?

Think of words with `code` in them? (*Morse code*, *post code*, *dress code*...)

Code existed **before computers**.

Code is about
*   transmitting information
*   giving instructions
*   **communication**

If I want to talk to my **grandma**, I need to use Italian. To communicate with you, I use English. To **talk to a computer**, I use..

It's **instructions** to a computer: extremely powerful, fundamentally thick.

### Thick machines

Imagine a computer is your most picky/pedantic **friend**: 

* **break down** every step, in order
* be extremely **precise**
* it will take you **literally**


## What are computers good at?

COMPUTERS → **Computing** (calculating very fast, comparing quantities), **repeating** (boring) tasks endlessly, **executing** instructions, **storing** data. 

### What are you good at?	

PEOPLE → **Spotting patterns** (connecting the dots), thinking **outside the box**, **inventing** new tools and new ways to use old **tools**.

**Code is a tool**, is how we can get computers to do the **heavy lifting for us**, so that we can focus on being **creative**.

PEOPLE are **good at writing code**.


## How do you learn to code?

Remember how you learned your first language as a child?

Like **learning a new language**, **translating** your ideas into code.

**Today** you're going to learn **2 new languages**.

<!-- A bit of **grammar** and **vocabulary**, and mostly you can learn by **copying**. -->

## Copy + hack

You learned your first language by copying people around you..

<!-- To learn typography, you copy and **edit** fonts. 

To become a pattern cutter, you **deconstruct** and copy good garments.

To make things on the Web, you **inspect** and copy good websites.

_Show Facebook > Inspect Element_ -->

**Today** you're going to **copy us** for a bit, then **hack** what you've copied into something **new**.


## Your brief

**Learn by doing**

Make an app that helps people **make lunch**.

The app must take in some human **input**, use **code** to manipulate it, and then present a human-readable **output**.


<!-- ## Today

You will make an **app**.  

We will show you a few **coding tricks** and we'll lay the **foundations** of your app together. 

Then you will explore the **potential of the Web** as an open platform for you to **express your creativity**. -->


## What is the Web?

We're building our app using Web technology.. so what is *the Web*?

The Web is not the Internet. If the Internet is a global **brain** (infrastructure), the Web is all the **memories and thoughts** that run on top of it.

Super-short history:

* The Internet started as a military project shortly after WW2. Fearing a soviet nuclear attack, the American army designed a **resilient de-centralised network**: if one *node* goes down, communication can still happen between the other nodes.

* Internet expands beyond the military and is adopted by business and academia. People start sending *emails*. 

* The WWW started as a way of **linking** academic documents together, over **2 computers in Switzerland**. 

* Tim Berners Lee (TBL): "Wouldn't it be great if I could have all my research data always **available** on this computer, and people can just fetch it from there, rather than me having to send emails? In fact, wouldn't it be great if **all the information in the World** could be always available? If every piece of data had an **address** where we can find it, like we find people at certain addresses?"

* TBL: **hypertext + Internet = WWW**, he specified a set of **rules** (HTTP) for computers to exchange documents over the Internet, and a standard **format** for these documents (HTML). 


## How does it WWWork?

You enter an address or click somewhere.

The **browser** turns your request into a HTTP request and sends it out to the Internet, to find a resource/page/site that responds to your request.

If you haven't mistyped your request, this will reach a server on the other end.

A **server** is a computer that is always on. Receives requests and cooks responses, which are sent back to the browser as **HTML+CSS+JS code**.

**RESTaurant analogy**. Sometimes (in the old days) the server sends back a **cooked meal**, in most cases it sends back a list of **ingredients** and a **recipe**.


## HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Different **languages**, different **concerns** (or jobs/purposes)

HTML → structure and content 

CSS → style and design 

JS → behaviour and logic

**RECIPE analogy** (ingredients - serving suggestions - method)

_BBC homepage example > disable CSS to show what code does what_

Today we're going to focus on HTML & CSS

### HTML

1. Set up the HTML box (hide the JS and CSS boxes)
* Write title and description without HTML tags 
* `h1` (useful for Google Fonts)
* `p`, a couple of them
* `input`, different types
* Difference between `value` and `placeholder`
* Add a `button` 

### CSS intro

Useful to show **selectors** and hide the `p`

* `h1` centred
* `color`

Save and open **Debug** view.

Introduce **Web Inspector**, HTML and CSS tabs.

Introduce colour picker (maybe pick a colour from Facebook). Everything is lost on *page refresh* so need to copy-paste into our code.

* `background`

Introduce [Kuler](https://color.adobe.com)

* `background-image`
* `background-size: cover;`
* CSS comments
* `background-repeat: no-repeat;` and may have to add `html {height: 100%;}`
* `font-size`
* `font-weight`
* [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
* Style `input` and `button`
	* `width: 90%; padding: 5%;`
	* `width: calc(100% - 1em); padding: .5em;`
	* `border: none;`
	* `border-radius`
	* `margin`
	
### Back to HTML	
	
```
<ul>
  <li>
    <h2>recipe title</h2>
    <img>
    <p>Ingredients, description, more info?</p>
    <a>Link to full recipe</a>  
  </li>
</ul>
```

### Final touches

* Transparency?

* Media queries?

* Make the app look proper on a phone. Google `how to stop phone zooming out pages`
* Make the app **full screen**. Google `how to hide address bar in mobile browser` and you should find [this tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/fullscreen/) 
* Add the app to your phone's **home screen**
