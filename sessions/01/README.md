# Session 1


# Apps from scratch

This course is about getting **creative** with **code**.

For many of you, this will be a **memorable day**. You'll write your **first line of code**, and in a few weeks you'll have made **your very own app**, from scratch!

It's going to be **challenging** and we want to make sure that you also have **fun**!

We're not here to talk at you, but to work with you and we want you to **work together** and help each other.


## Two words about ourselves

**No computer scientists**, learned code by ourselves and built a career on it.

* Yuki: studied art, now develops software at a post-production company (working on films like The Gladiator)
* Matteo: studied graphic design, built apps and games for the BBC and the Science Museum, now teaches at Ravensbourne

We're both curious and passionate about sharing our knowledge.

We believe **everyone can learn to code** and that's why we're here today.


## Introduce each other

We want this session to be **informal** and relaxed, so if you have any questions at any time just ask. We're also going to ask you many **questions**!

We'd like you to introduce yourself to your neighbour, and then we'll ask you to introduce each other to the rest of the group.

1. A bit about yourself
* Why are you on this course?
* What is your experience with coding so far?

You can jot down the answers on post-its and we'll then stick them on the wall...


## When is lunch?

Research shows that people focus much better when they know what time they're going to eat..

So, we will have **lunch break** at around 12:00 for 1 hour, aiming to wrap up by 3pm.

## Roadmap

### Day one

Setting the foundations: getting familiar with code (introducing two languages, **HTML & CSS**) and learning how to code the layout for an app.

Key questions: 
* What is *code*? 
* How do you learn to code?

### Day 1

Setting the foundations: getting familiar with code (introducing two languages, **HTML & CSS**) and learning how to code the layout for an app.

Key questions: 
* What is *code*? 
* How do you learn to code?

### Day 2

Stepping up a notch: set things in motion (introducing **JavaScript**) and learning how to use data from the Web in your code.

Key questions: 
* Where is *data*? 
* How do you harness is?

### Day 3

Learning how to visualise your ideas, sketch out possible solutions (introducing the **wireframing** method) and start a conversation with your team.

Key questions: 
* What is an *app*? 
* How do you design one?

### Day 4

Translating your wireframes into code: how to quickly **prototype and test** your app.

Key questions: 
* What does your app do? 
* How do you *test* it?

### Day 5

Polising up and presenting your prototypes.

Key questions: 
* What is your app value? 
* How do you communicate it?



## What is code?

Can you fill in the blanks?

Think of words with `code` in them? (*Morse code*, *post code*, *dress code*...)

Code existed **before computers**.

Code is about
*   transmitting information
*   giving instructions
*   **communication**

If I want to talk to my **grandma**, I need to use Italian. To communicate with you, I use English. To **talk to a computer**, I use..

It's **instructions** to a computer: extremely powerful, fundamentally thick.

### Thick machines

Imagine a computer is your most picky/pedantic **friend**: 

* **break down** every step, in order
* be extremely **precise**
* it will take you **literally**


## What are computers good at?

COMPUTERS → **Computing** (calculating very fast, comparing quantities), **repeating** (boring) tasks endlessly, **executing** instructions, **storing** data. 

### What are you good at?	

PEOPLE → **Spotting patterns** (connecting the dots), thinking **outside the box**, **inventing** new tools and new ways to use old **tools**.

**Code is a tool**, is how we can get computers to do the **heavy lifting for us**, so that we can focus on being **creative**.

PEOPLE are **good at writing code**.


## How do you learn to code?

Remember how you learned your first language as a child?

Like **learning a new language**, **translating** your ideas into code.

**Today** you're going to learn **2 new languages**.

<!-- A bit of **grammar** and **vocabulary**, and mostly you can learn by **copying**. -->

## Copy + hack

You learned your first language by copying people around you..

<!-- To learn typography, you copy and **edit** fonts. 

To become a pattern cutter, you **deconstruct** and copy good garments.

To make things on the Web, you **inspect** and copy good websites.

_Show Facebook > Inspect Element_ -->

**Today** you're going to **copy us** for a bit, then **hack** what you've copied into something **new**.


## Your brief

**Learn by doing**

Make an app that helps people **make lunch**.

The app must take in some human **input**, use **code** to manipulate it, and then present a human-readable **output**.


<!-- ## Today

You will make an **app**.  

We will show you a few **coding tricks** and we'll lay the **foundations** of your app together. 

Then you will explore the **potential of the Web** as an open platform for you to **express your creativity**. -->


## What is the Web?

We're building our app using Web technology.. so what is *the Web*?

The Web is not the Internet. If the Internet is a global **brain** (infrastructure), the Web is all the **memories and thoughts** that run on top of it.

Super-short history:

* The Internet started as a military project shortly after WW2. Fearing a soviet nuclear attack, the American army designed a **resilient de-centralised network**: if one *node* goes down, communication can still happen between the other nodes.

* Internet expands beyond the military and is adopted by business and academia. People start sending *emails*. 

* The WWW started as a way of **linking** academic documents together, over **2 computers in Switzerland**. 

* Tim Berners Lee (TBL): "Wouldn't it be great if I could have all my research data always **available** on this computer, and people can just fetch it from there, rather than me having to send emails? In fact, wouldn't it be great if **all the information in the World** could be always available? If every piece of data had an **address** where we can find it, like we find people at certain addresses?"

* TBL: **hypertext + Internet = WWW**, he specified a set of **rules** (HTTP) for computers to exchange documents over the Internet, and a standard **format** for these documents (HTML). 


## How does it WWWork?

You enter an address or click somewhere.

The **browser** turns your request into a HTTP request and sends it out to the Internet, to find a resource/page/site that responds to your request.

If you haven't mistyped your request, this will reach a server on the other end.

A **server** is a computer that is always on. Receives requests and cooks responses, which are sent back to the browser as **HTML+CSS+JS code**.

**RESTaurant analogy**. Sometimes (in the old days) the server sends back a **cooked meal**, in most cases it sends back a list of **ingredients** and a **recipe**.


## HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Different **languages**, different **concerns** (or jobs/purposes)

HTML → structure and content 

CSS → style and design 

JS → behaviour and logic

**RECIPE analogy** (ingredients - serving suggestions - method)

_BBC homepage example > disable CSS to show what code does what_

Today we're going to focus on HTML & CSS
